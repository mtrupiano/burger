# Sandwich Consumer (fun, basic full-stack application)

## Description
This is a simple CRUD application that is a truly full-stack web application, consisting of:  

 - A mySQL database containing a list of sandwiches and whether or not they've been 'consumed'
 - An express server that collects and updates data from the database and serves front-end content
 - A styled HTML web interface

## Installation
Clone the repository and run `npm i` in the repository's local directory.

## Usage
A deployed version of this application can be found [here](https://immense-tundra-11037.herokuapp.com/).

Update a sandwich's status by clicking 'COSUME...' or 'RESET'. Add a new sandwich using the form.
